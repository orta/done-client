This project currently uses the Cocotron cocoa libraries to compile so that one day I can attempt a windows port. Other then that it's not a very complex application, All it really needs to do is send off some HTTP requests to the server.

If you want to see what it currently looks like on the server side you can see it here http://ortatherox.com/logs/
