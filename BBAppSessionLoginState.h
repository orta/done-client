// This singleton class handles the state of the running app in the users login items list (called
// Session Login items by the LSSharedFileList API).

// It sets up an observer of the Session Login List and keeps track if the user changes the state
// in System Preferences or any other outside app. The property isAppInSessionLoginList will be updated 
// when that happens.

// isAppInSessionLoginList is only meant to represent the state, so do not set it yourself. 
// Use the four instance methods for that. When changing the state, the state is re-read from LSSharedFileList 
// so isAppInSessionLoginList should never not represent the current state.

// Since there is no way to recover or re-apply a state change there are no returned errors. If it doesn't
// work then isAppInSessionLoginList will not be updated.

// NOTE: The LSSharedFileList API is only documented in the header file at:
// file://localhost/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Headers/LSSharedFileList.h
